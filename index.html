                    My name is Alan Vincent but I go by Colton. I began my job at Intermountain Rigging & Heavyhaul two
                    years ago. I started as a yard assistant doing tasks such as weedwacking, spreading rock in a
                    skidster, and organizing equipment around the yard with a forklift. While working at IRH I got
                    certified in forklifts. With this certification I am now able to operate all lift trucks, such as
                    boom lifts, skidster, and versalifts. Shortly after that I gained a new skill with weldng. My day to
                    day is constantly changing since being promoted to a yard foreman.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have not always envisioned myself doing a labor intensive job for the rest of my career. I've
                    always had an interest in computers and coding. With some help from family I was able to find <a
                        href="https://bootcamps.continue.utah.edu/coding/?utm_source=university-course-page">University
                        of Utah Full Stack Coding bootcamp</a>. With the new skills I will obtain after completing the
                    bootcamp I aspire to find a career in the coding industry. I look forward to the many doors and
                    opportunities yet to come. As well as the amazing knowledge I will gain.
